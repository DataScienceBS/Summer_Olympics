# Summer_Olympics  

### Author Background
I have limited coding experience. I initiated this project in February, 2018, while enrolled in the [Nashville Software School, Data Science Bootcamp, Cohort 1](http://www.nashvillesoftwareschool.com). The first Data Science Cohort started October 17th, 2018, and began with 10 weeks of in depth Python learning. This included 3 Data Question projects using open data. Upon creation of this project, the Data Science Cohort has spent 6 weeks learning R to prepare for a first Shiny App.   

### Schedule of Work (February 15 - March 10, 2018)
1.	Obtain  Data (February 6th)
2.	Clean & Explore the Data (February 15th)
3.	Build & Deploy Shiny App (February 27th)
4.	Document/Pitch Shiny App with a Presentation (March 10th)
  
### Known Issues and Challenges  
With over a century of data, I anticipate the names of countries have changed over time and will need to be addressed. There is also a very fine level of detail in the data that will need to be presented in a readable, ingestible format. Finding a way to display the immense amount of data will be the largest challenge. The data is structured by Olympic Year, Location, Sport (Aquatics), Discipline (Swimming), Event (1500m relay), Medal (Gold), Medalists (each solo or team athlete), and Gender.
